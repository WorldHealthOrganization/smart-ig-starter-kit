Aggregation o-- Department : Aggregation\n- Illustrates that an object or process \ngroups several other objects/processes.\n  Example: A Data model aggregates several Data Elements.\nThe Data Elements can exist without the Data Model.
Composition *-- Course : Composition\n- Indicates that an object or process \nis composed of one or more other objects/processes.\n Example: A CodeSystem is composed of Concepts.\n   If the CodeSystem is deleted, the Concepts cease to exist.
Access --> Database : Access (Read/Write)\n- Indicates that a process has an artifact as input or output.\n Example: To Create a Persona has L2 Generic Personas as input.
RelatedTo -- Research : Related To\n- A generic relationship \nwith a label specifying the type of connection.\n   Example: A ValueSet is related to a Data Element.
FlowsTo -r-> NextActivity :   Activity **Flows to** Activity\n              - A relationship where one activity follows another.             \n       Example: "Create CQL" flows to "Encode CQL".
