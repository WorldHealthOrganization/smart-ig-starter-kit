Validating Smart Guidelines L3 is a responsibility of the author. This comprehends several activities:

1. Ensure that the content of the L2 is correctly represented by L3 artifacts
2. Verify that the rules for each created artifact are followed e.g. that there are no issues with the artifacts
3. Confirm the functionality of L3 artifacts - for example that the StructureMaps extraction gives exactly the expected output, using reference tooling
4. Address any other dependencies and governance issues e.g. updates to common glossary, etc.


These are described below:

## Content coverage
This is a manual effort. The L3 author is expected to ensure that all the expectations on the L2 are covered by some artifact. 

## Verify confirmance with QA rules 
The quality checks are increasingly automated. Every Guide contains a QA page (see [QA Check](qa_check.html)) which automatically identifies issues like missing elements, references not found, etc.

## Validating L3 artifact functionality
There's a reference set of tools that can be used to validate the functionality of the artifacts, namely StructureMaps and Decision/Scheduling logic and indicators.
Each Guide has a Testing page that contains links to enable local testing.

## Follow governance process
The results of L3 authoring can be sukject to governance processes outside the authoring of a specific L3 guide, e.g. creating common terms or common libraries, addressing issues or requesting changes in dependencies.
For these, the L3 author is a contributor to a shared pool of resources, and the governance process will determine how to onboard any such artifacts and issues.
