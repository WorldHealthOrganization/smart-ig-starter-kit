  This Starter Kit describes a SOP for authoring L3 Implementation Guides for SMART Guidelines.

  The SMART guidelines present a set of consistent specifications intended to be reused and augmented / adapted worldwide. The creation, validation and maintenance of an increasing number of smart guidelines - by a range of experts at the Organization and an ever growing community - requires a common set of procedures and associated tooling.

In addition, the adoption and adaptation of SMART Guidelines by the different countries and entities should be supported by a known and replicable process. This enables:
* Education and planning, targeted at the right groups
* Standard tools for facilitating and automating tasks
* Quality control and validation
* Process monitoring and improvement
