The Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) consists of 6 documents, 1 narrative document with Excel spreadsheets that cover 5 of the 9 key components of a DAK:

				<p>The template for the &ldquo;main&rdquo; DAK document. The narrative text can and should be changed as needed for each specific health domain. However, highlighted throughout the document are places where health domain specificity should be added.</p>
				<p>The following narrative components: health interventions and recommendations (component 1), generic personas (component 2) and user scenarios (component 3) can be directly edited and drafted within the DAK document template.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The generic business processes and workflows diagrams would be generated in another tool, such as<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software">Microsoft Visio</a>,<a href="https://camunda.com/download/modeler/">Camunda Modeler</a>,<a href="https://www.drawio.com/">drawio.com</a>, etc. The selected tool should:</p>
				<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be able to cover the needs in terms of BPMN notation (see the table &ldquo;Business process symbols used in workflows&rdquo; from the template);</p>
				<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be able to export the diagrams in .bpmn format;</p>
				<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not pose issues in terms of licencing.</p>
				<p>The diagrams should then be included in the main DAK document as an image file. The &lsquo;.bpmn&rsquo; file of each diagram could be exported and uploaded to an online repository (such as a GitHub repository). A link to the repository can be also included in this document. In this way anyone wanting to reuse/modify/adapt the business processes, based on local needs and context, can easily do that.</p>
