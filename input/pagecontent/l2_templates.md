The “main” DAK document _(is the template for the final PDF)_|Written in Word document, published in PDF|The template for the “main” DAK document. The narrative text can and should be changed as needed for each specific health domain. However, highlighted throughout the document are places where health domain specificity should be added. <br>The following components: Health interventions and recommendations, generic personas, user scenarios and other narrative components can be directly edited and drafted within the DAK document template.<br>The business process workflow diagrams would be generated in another tool such as. [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software), [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/), [drawio.com](https://www.drawio.com/), etc. The selected tool should:<br> - be able to cover the needs in terms of BPMN notation (see the table “Business process symbols used in workflows” from the document);<br> - be able to export the diagrams in .bpmn format; <br> - not pose issues in terms of licencing. <br> The workflow diagrams should then be included in the main DAK document as an image file. <br> For the data dictionary, decision support logic, scheduling logic, indicators and performance metrics, and functional and non-functional requirement components, it is recommended that they are finalized in the Excel spreadsheet first before copying content over into the “main” DAK document.|
