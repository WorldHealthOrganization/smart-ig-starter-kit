    This Implementation Guide, <em>smart-ig-empty</em>, is a GitHub <em>template repostiory</em> which means that it can be used as a starting point for developing a new Implementation Guide.  Following these instructions will ensure consistent styling and content structure to ease adoption of WHO's <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines">SMART Guidelines</a>.

  </p>
  <h3>Creating a new WHO SMART Guidline</h3><a name="new-smart"> </a>

  <h4>Creating a new GitHub repository</h4><a name="github"> </a>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Choose an apporpriate for the Implementation Guide you are developing.  The code of this implemenation guide is <em>smart-ig-empty</em>.  For the sake of the following instructions, we will assume that you have chosen <em>smart-ig-my-guide</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      This Implementation Guide is a template repository and you should <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository">create a repository from this template</a> named smart-ig-my-guide.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don't have a gh-pages branch, you can reate an empty gh-pages branch on the new repo using the commands:
      <blockquote>
	<pre>git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset --hard
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initializing gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout main</pre>
      </blockquote>
      Then, under the repoistory, navigate to 'Settings->Pages' and set the 'Source' to 'gh-pages'.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Modifying the template repository</h4><a name="modify"> </a>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Modify the following files as indiciated:
      <dl>
	<dt>ig.ini</dt>
	<dd>
	  Change the text <em>smart-ig-empty</em> to <em>smart-ig-my-guide</em> in the 'ig' field.
	</dd>
	<dt>sushi-config.yaml</dt>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Choose a title for this Implementation Guide and update the 'title' field.</li>
	    <li>Modify the 'email' field as apporpriate. <mark>TODO: create a SMART Guidlines email</mark></li>
	    <li>Modify the 'description' field as appopriate.</li>
	    <li>Change the text <em>smart-ig-empty</em> to <em>smart-ig-my-guide</em> in the 'id', 'canonical' and 'name' fields</li>
	    <li>Change the 'date' field to the current date</li>
	    <li>Add an appropriate dependencies under the 'dependencies' field.</li>
	  </ul>
	  See <a href="https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/configuration/">sushi config</a> instructions for more infomration on this file.
	</dd>
	<dt>input/data/features.yml</dt>
	<dd>
	  Change the text <em>smart-ig-empty</em> to <em>smart-ig-my-guide</em> in the 'feedback.dashboard.url' field <mark>@Jose: anything else to do here?</mark>
	</dd>
      </dl>      
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Country adaptation of an existing guide</h3><a name="adaptation"> </a>
  <p>
    Basic country adaptation of SMART Implementation Guide has a few additional steps. In this case, rather than creating a new repostiory based off of <em>smart-ig-empty</em> you should fork an existing repository, such as <em>smart-ig-anc</em>.         Determine the appropriate ISO-alpha3 and M49 ISO-3166 <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/">jurisdicition codes</a>.  For the purposes of these instructions, suppose it is <em>EXA</em> and <em>999</em> for an 'Example' country. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Name the forked repository the same as the repository you are forking from but you should add the ISO-alpha3 code to then end.  For example <em>smart-ig-anc</em> would beceom <em>smart-ig-anc-exa</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      Further modify the following files:
      <dl>
	<dt>ig.ini</dt>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Change the occurence of <em>who</em> in the 'ig' field to the lower-case version of the country code, <em>exa</em>, or whatever is the convention in your country.  For example, 'ig = fsh-generated/resources/ImplementationGuide-fhir.<em>exa</em>.smart-ig-anc.json.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>sushi-config.yaml</dt>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Modigy the 'id' field and replace <em>who</em> with the lower-case version of the country code, <em>exa</em>, or whatever is the convention in your country.  For example 'id: fhir.<em>exa</em>.smart-ig-anc-exa</li>	    
	    <li>Modifty the 'jursidiciton' field by changing the <em>#001</em> to the appropriate M49 code found <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/">here</a>. For example 'jurisdiction: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#<em>999</em>'</li>
	    <li>Update the 'publisher.name' and 'publisher.url' fields to something appropriate</li>
	    <li>Update the 'email' field to something appropriate</li>
	    <li>Change the 'title' field to add in the country name yet still show that it is adapted from the WHO SMART Guidelines.  For example, 'WHO SMART Guideline: Antenatal Care' becomes 'WHO SMART Guideline: Antenatal Care for Example Country' </li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>
      </dl>	
    </li>
    <li>Create new ValueSets and appopriate ConceptMaps based on country requirements</li>
    <li>Modify data collection resources (e.g. Questionnaires), logical models, and document structures to account for country specific data fields</li>
  </ul>

  
  <h3>Directory layout for content</h3><a name="directory-structure"> </a>
  <ul>

  <h3>Generating an implmentation guide</h3><a name="generation"> </a>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Install Implemenation Guide Publisher dependencies (Ubuntu instructions)
      <blockquote><pre>apt-get install npm node.js jekyll
npm install -g sushi</pre></blockquote>
      See <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/2020May/sushi.html#installation">sushi install</a> for more details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Run the IG Publisher in the root of the github repo (unix-y instructions):
      <blockquote><pre>./_updatePublisher.sh
./_genonce.sh</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      If all is successful, open the local file 'output/index.html' in your browser and review the content as well as the quality assurance page under 'output/qa.html'
    </li>
    <li>
      Do a github commit, let the github action run.  For a WHO SMART Guideline you can open GitHub pages at <a href="{{ site.data.fhir.packageId | split: '.' | last | prepend: 'https://WorldHealthOrganization.github.io/' }}">{{ site.data.fhir.packageId | split: '.' | last }} </a>  but change  <em>smart-ig-empty</em> to <em>smart-ig-my-guide</em>.  
    </li>
  </ul>
