The SMART Guidelines define the provision of guidance and monitoring using a structured, standardized representation of knowledge of different types, which are represented in L2 and L3. The L3 authoring process consists of creating the L3 artifacts from the corresponding L2 artifact (and its adjacent artifacts) - for example creating PlanDefinitions from a Decision Table.

            <td>Requirement</td>
            <td>A detailed specification of a systemâ€™s needs, derived from user scenarios, personas, and business processes. It forms the foundation for system design and testing.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Data Element</td>
            <td>An atomic piece of data, often a part of data objects. Elements get transformed, coded, or mapped as per transformation logic or coding systems.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Coding</td>
            <td>The assignment of codes to data elements, where applicable, using standard terminologies and mapped to other codes as needed. Coding aids in ensuring that data elements are universally understood and interpretable.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Transformation logic</td>
            <td>The rules applied to change data from one format or structure to another. Often influenced by decision tables, coding, and mapping to ensure data integrity.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Test Case</td>
            <td>A set of conditions for which a system is assessed, often derived from requirements and user scenarios. They ensure the system performs as expected.</td>
