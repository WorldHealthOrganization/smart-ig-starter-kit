For each type of L3 artifact that needs to be authored, the SOP is structured in the following manner:

* Inputs 
  - from L2
  - Pre-existing content such as central glossaries
* Outputs
  - Into the Implementation Guide
  - Profiles 
  - Visualization needs
  - Into other processes
* Activities overview
  - Input verification  
  - Details about the activities that are executed. 
  - Data models for the artifacts created (this is used for profiles) 
  - Tooling needed for authors 
  - Authoring (based on profiles) 
  - Review and testing 
* Output Criteria / Definition of Done - checks for ensuring the quality of the output
* Change Tracking
  - Change tracking notes
* Tooling
  - Available tooling and links to documentation
* Known Issues and dependencies
  - Decisions pending
  - Tooling dependencies

The artifact types, also use ArchiMate drawings to give a visual representation for the artifacts being authored, or the activities that are needed. To understand more about the diagrams, please visit the (Diagram Legend)[diagram_legend.html] page.
