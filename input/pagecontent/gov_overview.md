SMART Guidelines artifacts are meant to be interoperable and shared. This means that they can be maintained and possibly reused and referenced across Guidelines.

The authoring process currently identifies some artifacts that are subject to "common" governance i.e. being maintained not within one single guideline, but as possibly reusable artifacts:

* Glossary - Data Elements may be defined in a common base - for example "Patient given name" and "Pregnancy status" are definitions that should be common across SMART Guidelines
* Business Processes, Personas - several of such artifacts can be used when building up an architecture from the modular components, aiming at reuse or consistency
* ValueSets and CodeSystems - Terminology assets are inherently reusable across specifications.
* CQL Common Libraries - code libraries can be maintained for reuse 
* Common profiles - Reusing technical parts of the specification allows further technical interoperability.


Reusable artifacts would be managed not only by their immediate author, but would have a different governance process - as an example, A central Glossary, hosted on a repository, may contain commonly agreed definitions. Authors are then encouraged to use terms from that glossary, instead of recreating definitions.
