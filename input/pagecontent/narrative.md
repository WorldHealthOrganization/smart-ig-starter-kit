Narrative content can be used for different purposes:
* Narrative pages describing the content
* Auxiliary narrative for the resources - for example introductory text to a profile or Library.

General authoring guidance:

* Pages should only contain headings of level 3 and above - 1 or 2 are not supported. 
* [PlantUML diagrams](http://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/ig-guidance/diagrams.html) can be added
* All narrative pages must be listed in the ImplementationGuide resource (or equivalently in the sushi-config.yaml).

<div class="info-box">

    All narrative pages must be listed in the ImplementationGuide resource (or equivalently in the sushi-config.yaml).
