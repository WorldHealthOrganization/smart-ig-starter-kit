Scheduling logic represents the schedule of actions that are expected to be followed. For example a vaccination schedule. This doesn't necessarily mean that the actions will be executed; the schedule is currently only expected to be communicated to the patient or professionals, as informations. The professionals, based on the schedule, can always evaluate the needed actions.


Scenario:
Patient visits clinic today
Last vaccine was 6 months ago
Next vaccine is therefore 18 months from now

Communication request comes from this - as an output of a scheduling 
Other Example :  create reminders to come to vaccine tomorrow
