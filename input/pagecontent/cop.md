The SMART Guidelines Community brings together technologists, developers, Ministries of Health, funders, and other stakeholders involved in the development and adoption of SMART Guidelines. This ecosystem promotes collaboration and innovation to enhance the implementation of SMART Guidelines globally. 

### Quick Start for New Contributors:  

Welcome to the SMART Guidelines Community—we’re excited to have you on board! The SMART Guidelines Community thrives on collaboration, innovation, and shared expertise. Whether you're a newcomer or an experienced contributor, your participation adds value to this growing ecosystem of digital health tools.  

#### Join the Community Platform:  

For asynchronous communication, we primarily use FHIR Zulip. Here, you can connect with the broader community of FHIR developers and we’ve made a dedicated channel  for SMART Guidelines named(channel: smart) . You can join FHIR Zulip here: https://chat.fhir.org/  

#### Participate in SMART Guidelines Community of Practice (CoP) Calls:  

The SMART Guidelines CoP calls are held every Monday from 3:00–4:00 PM CET. These calls serve as a platform for discussing: 
- Authoring FHIR implementation guides for clinical content. 
- Implementing SMART Guidelines content into existing or new systems. 

The CoP calls are chaired by the WHO SMART Guidelines team and organized around active workstreams. Currently, we have four workstreams, L2 to L3, L3 to L4, L4, and Capacity Building. Each workstream has two or more workstream leads and the participation in the workstream is entirely voluntary.
