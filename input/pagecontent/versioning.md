## Versioning

* TODO: Discussion of Semver and connection to release process

## History
After [publication](), any changes to the L3 resources should be tracked. 
Tracking changes should include:

* Repository issues (GitHub issues)
* Differencing between different versions of a publication
* Release Notes

### Github Issues
* Every change should be traceable to a GitHub issue. This allows tracking the change and any approvals/discussions, as well as assisting in creating release notes.

* State of each issue: GitHub issues should not be considered "done" when the change is agreed, but only when the change is effectively implemented and tested and the respective criteria is met.

For some artifacts, the FHIR ImplementationGuide tooling may highlight the differences in the content of the artifacts between two versions. This can be used to track and demonstrate the detailed artifact changes.
