Authoring L3 means taking the L2 input and, using the recommended processes and tools, create the L3 artifacts. While the exact authoring steps depend on the inputs, the key sequence could normally consist of the following steps: 

* [Logical Models](l3_logicalmodels.md)
* [Profiles](l3_profiles.md)
* [Forms](l3_forms.md)
* [Libraries](l3_libraries.md)
* [Decision Tables](l3_decisiontables.md)
* [Indicators](l3_indicators.md)
* [Scheduling Logic](l3_schedulinglogic.md)
* [Test Cases](l3_testing.md)
* [Personas](l3_personas.md)
* [Scenarios](l3_scenarios.md)
* [Processes](l3_processes.md)
* [Requirements](l3_requirements.md)
* [Examples](l3_examples.md)

Before that, the first step in L3 production is an input verification of the L2 content. 

The L2 content is presented in the artifacts represented in the diagram below:

Authoring presumes the L2 content is available and consistent. It is possible that the L2 content gets changed, notably due to input from L3 authoring. It is important to track the versions of L2 content, especially when adapting L2 or L3 to a local implementation, in order to track changes and assess impact of those changes.For this same reason, there's a versioning and change management section in this document.
