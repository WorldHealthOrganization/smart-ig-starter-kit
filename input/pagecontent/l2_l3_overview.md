The first step in L3 production is an input verification of the L2 content. 

The L2 content is presented in the artifacts represented in the diagram below:

* It is important to track the versions of L2 content, especially when adapting L2 or L3 to a local implementation, in order to track changes and assess impact of those changes.For this same reason, there's a versioning and change management section in this document.
