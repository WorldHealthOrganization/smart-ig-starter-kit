* Canonical url: http://worldhealthorganization.github.io/smart-ig-starter-kit
* Package id: who.fhir.???? Or who.fhir.smart.??? Or who.smart.fhir.?
* National adaptations: TBD
  - If the country or region has an an affiliate, it is recommended that the affiliate includes the smart guidelines in their
      - Package id: hl7.fhir.country.smart.xxx
  - If there is no affiliate or the affiliate declines, other organizations should step inâ€¦



For National adaptations: 
- If the country or region has an an HL7 affiliate, the HL7 affiliate can include the smart guidelines in their publication process and use the defined conventions
  - Package id convention is defined locally, e.g. `hl7.fhir.country.smart.xxx`
- If there is no affiliate or the affiliate declines, other organizations 

* L3 authors should ensure that the content has some feedback mechanism.
