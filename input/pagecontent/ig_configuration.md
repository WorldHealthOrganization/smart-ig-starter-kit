### **ImplementationGuide configuration**

**Actor**: L3 Author

 After initializing the IG, it must be configured.   
   
For WHO-authored Guidelines (i.e. not for adaptations), the configuration includes:


* Canonical url: http://worldhealthorganization.github.io/smart-ig-starter-kit
* Package id: `smart.who.int.<ig_code>`


For adaptations:
- If the country or region has an an HL7 affiliate, the affiliate can include the smart guidelines in their publication scope and process
   - Package id: hl7.fhir.country.smart.xxx
- If there is no affiliate or the affiliate declines, other organizations should step inâ€¦

* L3 authors should ensure that the content has some feedback mechanism, for example GitHub issues.
