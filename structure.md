## Structure of the SOP IG

For each type of L3 artifact that needs to be authored, the SOP is structured in the following manner:

* Inputs 
* from L2
* Pre-existing content such as central glossaries
 
* Outputs 
* Into the Implementation Guide
* Profiles
* Visualization needs
* Into other processes
 
* Activities overview 
* Input verification
* Details about the activities that are executed.
* Data models for the artifacts created (this is used for profiles)
* Tooling needed for authors
* Authoring (based on profiles)
* Review and testing
 
* Output Criteria / Definition of Done - checks for ensuring the quality of the output
* Change Tracking 
* Change tracking notes
 
* Tooling 
* Available tooling and links to documentation
 
* Known Issues and dependencies 
* Decisions pending
* Tooling dependencies
 

The artifact types, also use ArchiMate drawings to give a visual representation for the artifacts being authored, or the activities that are needed. To understand more about the diagrams, please visit the [Diagram Legend](diagram_legend.md) page.
